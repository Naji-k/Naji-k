# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Naji Kanounji
### ðŸš€ Software Engineer | Backend & Mobile Developer | Automation Enthusiast

#### Iâ€™m a software engineer with experience in backend development, mobile apps, and system-level programming. 
#### My journey started in mobile development (iOS & Android), but my curiosity for deeper engineering led me to [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/) which is part of the [42 network](https://42.fr/en/network-42/), where I built projects in C, C++, Python, and full-stack web applications.
#### âœ¨ Obsessed with finding better solutions and automating the boring stuff.
You can find an overview of all my codam projects [here](https://github.com/Naji-k/Codam-projects).
